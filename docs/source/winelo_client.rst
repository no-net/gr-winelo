Client
******

As with the server module, it should never be necessary that you, as a user, have to directly work with the Twisted client.
If you want to connect GNU Radio flowgraphs to the WiNeLo server, the easiest way it to rely on the GNU Radio Companion bindings that we created.
The bindings can be found under the category *WiNeLo* in the GNU Radio Companion.
Documentation detailing its usage can be directly found inside GNU Radio Companion.
